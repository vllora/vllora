## Using Homebrew (Recommended)

First, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you haven't already, then:

```bash
brew tap vllora/vllora
brew install vllora
```


### Start the vLLora:

```bash
vllora
```

> The server will start on `http://localhost:9090` and the UI will be available at `http://localhost:9091`. 

vLLora uses OpenAI-compatible chat completions API, so when your AI agents make calls through vLLora, it automatically collects traces and debugging information for every 
interaction.

### Test Send your First Request

1. **Configure API Keys**: Visit `http://localhost:9091` to configure your AI provider API keys through the UI
2. **Make a request** to see debugging in action:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9090/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]
  }'
```

## Features

**Real-time Tracing** - Monitor AI agent interactions as they happen with live observability of calls, tool interactions, and agent workflow. See exactly what your agents are doing in real-time.
