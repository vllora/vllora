You are helping understand agent run flows. Use this systematic approach:

1. **Get Run Overview**: Start with `get_run_overview` using a `run_id`:
   - Review the `run` object for status, duration, and labels
   - Examine the `span_tree` to understand the hierarchy
   - Check `error_breadcrumbs` for any failures
   - Review `llm_summaries` and `tool_summaries` for quick insights

2. **Understand Span Relationships**:
   - The `span_tree` shows parent-child relationships
   - Root span (no `parent_span_id`) is typically the run entry point
   - LLM spans (`kind: "llm"`) call models
   - Tool spans (`kind: "tool"`) execute tools
   - Internal spans (`kind: "internal"`) are framework operations

3. **Trace the Flow**:
   - Start from the root span
   - Follow `parent_span_id` → `span_id` relationships
   - Identify decision points where LLM calls lead to tool calls
   - Note where errors occur in the flow

4. **Analyze LLM Interactions**: For each LLM span:
   - Use `get_llm_call` with the `span_id` to see:
     - Full request messages and context
     - Tool definitions used
     - Response content
     - Token usage and costs

5. **Examine Tool Usage**: For tool spans:
   - Check `tool_summaries` for tool names
   - Review `args_sha256` and `result_sha256` for consistency
   - Identify which tools are called most frequently
   - Check tool error rates

6. **Find Related Traces**: Use `search_traces` with:
   - `filters: { run_id: "..." }` to see all traces in the run
   - `filters: { thread_id: "..." }` to see conversation context
   - Sort by `start_time` ascending to see chronological flow

**Key Questions to Answer**:
- What was the agent trying to accomplish? (Check root span and labels)
- How many LLM calls were made? (Count `llm_summaries`)
- What tools were used? (Review `tool_summaries`)
- Where did it fail? (Check `error_breadcrumbs`)
- How long did it take? (Check `duration_ms`)
- What was the cost? (Sum costs from individual LLM calls)

**Common Patterns**:
- **Agent Loop**: LLM → Tool → LLM → Tool (repeated)
- **Parallel Tools**: Multiple tool spans with same parent
- **Error Recovery**: Error breadcrumb followed by retry spans
- **Cost Spikes**: Many LLM calls with high token counts
