You are helping analyze costs and token usage. Follow this approach:

**1. Get Cost Overview**: Use `search_traces` with:
   - `include: { costs: true, tokens: true }`
   - Filter by time range to analyze specific periods
   - Filter by model to compare model costs
   - Sort by costs to find most expensive operations

**2. Analyze Token Usage**: Review `tokens` field:
   - **Input Tokens**: Size of requests (messages + tools)
   - **Output Tokens**: Size of responses
   - **Total Tokens**: Combined usage
   - **Efficiency**: Low output/input ratio may indicate inefficiency

**3. Compare Models**: Use `get_recent_stats` to:
   - See total calls per model
   - Combine with `search_traces` filtered by model to get costs
   - Identify which models are most expensive
   - Compare cost per call across models

**4. Detailed Cost Breakdown**: Use `get_llm_call` to:
   - See exact `costs` and `tokens` for specific calls
   - Review request size (messages, tools) affecting costs
   - Identify expensive patterns (long messages, many tools)

**5. Analyze Run Costs**: Use `get_run_overview` to:
   - See all LLM calls in a run (`llm_summaries`)
   - Use `get_llm_call` for each span to sum costs
   - Identify expensive runs
   - Find cost optimization opportunities

**Cost Optimization Strategies**:

**Reduce Input Tokens**:
- Shorten message history
- Simplify tool definitions
- Remove unnecessary context
- Use more efficient prompts

**Reduce Output Tokens**:
- Set `max_tokens` limits appropriately
- Use faster/cheaper models for simple tasks
- Cache frequent responses

**Model Selection**:
- Use cheaper models for simple tasks
- Reserve expensive models for complex tasks
- Compare cost vs quality trade-offs

**Tool Usage**:
- Minimize tool definitions when possible
- Cache tool results
- Optimize tool call frequency

**Common Cost Issues**:
- **Token Waste**: High input tokens with low value
- **Model Overuse**: Using expensive models unnecessarily
- **Tool Bloat**: Excessive tool definitions
- **Inefficient Prompts**: Long prompts that don't add value
- **No Caching**: Repeated identical calls

**Cost Analysis Checklist**:
1. Get overall costs using `search_traces` with cost include
2. Identify most expensive models
3. Find expensive individual calls
4. Analyze token efficiency
5. Compare costs across time periods
6. Identify optimization opportunities
